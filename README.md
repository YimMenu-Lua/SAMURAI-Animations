> [!NOTE]
> Due to life being a pain in my _a$$_, I will not have the time to improve this script so if anybody is willing to contribute animations or new features, feel free to to do so. There will be a short comment at the top of the **[animdata.lua](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/SAMURAI-Animations/blob/main/animdata.lua)** file explaining my mess. Pull requests are welcome.

## FAQ 

> _Yimmenu already has a built-in animation player. Why use a separate script?_

- This script spawns animation props and particle effects. It's the only reason why I wrote it.
- You don't have to mess with any settings, the appropriate flags for each animation are already setup.

> _Why are there only a few animations?_

- This script was written solely for roleplaying purposes. It will never have every animation in the game but only a select few but more will be added as I find the time to do so.

## Upcoming Features :

- Merge [SAMURAI-Scenarios](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/SAMURAI-Scenarios) and this script into one. (maybe call it _YimActions_? idk)
- Add More Animations.
- Add a "favorites" tab (probably).
