## Lua script for Yimmenu to play various GTA 5 animations.

![samurais_animations](https://github.com/xesdoog/SAMURAI-s-Animations/assets/66764345/be26aff9-5ad8-4918-92d4-a9bee03bf3df)

## Usage :

- Download both _samurais_animations.lua_ and _animdata.lua_ and place them in _%AppData%\YimMenu\scripts_
- Open **YimMenu**, select **SAMURAIs Animations**, choose an animation from the list then press **Play**. You can now close the menu.
- To stop playing an animation you can either open the menu again and press **Stop** or simply press ' **X** ' on keyboard / ' **LT** ' on controller.

## FAQ :

_Yimmenu already has a built-in animation player. Why use a separate script?_

- This script spawns animation props. It's the only reason why I wrote it.
- You don't have to configure the animations. The appropriate flags are already setup.

_Why are there only a few animations?_

- This is a work in progress I added a handful of animations for testing purposes. More will be added as I find the time to do so.

## Known Issues :

- ~~Sometimes when stopping an animation, the player's character may clip through the ground. This happens with low positioned animations like sitting or lying down. I don't know why but for now, just tap W after stopping the animation and you should be positioned correctly.~~ **FIXED.**

- ~~When changing to a different animation without stopping the previous one, the prop will become stuck to your character so make sure yo press the **Stop** button before choosing a different animation.~~ **FIXED.** *(n00b mistake)*.
