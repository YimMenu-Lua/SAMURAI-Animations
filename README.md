## Lua script for Yimmenu to play various GTA 5 animations.

![samurais_animations](https://github.com/xesdoog/SAMURAI-s-Animations/assets/66764345/be26aff9-5ad8-4918-92d4-a9bee03bf3df)

## NOTE :

- Due to life being a pain in my _a$$_, I will not have the time to improve this script so if anybody is willing to contribute animations or new features, feel free to to do so. There will be a short comment at the top of the **animdata.lua** file explaining my messy n00b approach. Pull requests are welcome.

## FAQ :

_Yimmenu already has a built-in animation player. Why use a separate script?_

- This script spawns animation props. It's the only reason why I wrote it.
- You don't have to configure the animations. The appropriate flags are already setup.

_Why are there only a few animations?_

- This is a work in progress. I added a handful of animations for testing purposes. More will be added as I find the time to do so.
- This script was written solely for roleplaying purposes. It will never have every animation in the game but only a select few.

## Upcoming Features :

- Merge [SAMURAI-Scenarios](https://github.com/YimMenu-Lua/SAMURAI-Scenarios) and this script into one. (maybe call it _YimActions_? idk)
- Add More Animations.
- Add a "favorites" tab (probably).
